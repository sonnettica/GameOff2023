SCALE...
An acronym?
A party-hosting-style game where the number of people begins to rapidly *scale*?
    - What systems would be needed?
        - System for managing number of people, system for getting people to come to the party
    - Is it too complicated?
        - Maybe, just depends on how much I can work and not let the scope creep take over.
    - Would it be *interesting and enjoyable*?
        - This is the part that's like french toast: very easy to fuck up
